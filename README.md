# Non-Profit Explorer Backend (work in progress) 

## Overview  
The **Non-Profit Explorer** backend is designed to provide a seamless way for users to query the **IRS Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract (EO BMF)** using natural language. 

## Features (thinking through)
- **Natural Language Querying**: Users can input queries in plain text and retrieve relevant results from the IRS EO BMF dataset.  
- **Architecture**: Built with **Django**, **AWS**, and **Iceberg Tables**, ensuring flexibility and performance.

-  **990 Data Chatbot** – AI-powered assistant for navigating IRS Form 990 data.  
-  **Data Explorer App** – Interactive dashboard for nonprofit research and insights.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Backend**: Django, Python  
- **Data Storage**: Apache Iceberg, AWS S3
